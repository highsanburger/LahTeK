\author{Syed Khalid}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\begin{enumerate}
  \item RT boasts about his hyper-capitalistic company's philanthropic interests, with a strong claim that the company's interests are not in profit but only in the nation.
  \item RT analyses how the needs of the nation have been inverted, corrupted even by huge MNCs.
  \item RT expounds the many seeming virtues of the TATA work culture. He also continues to confess his many mistakes as a leader. 
  \item RT gives many examples of his humility.
\end{enumerate}
